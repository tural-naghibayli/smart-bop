        <p class='wibop-give-margin-class-p'>A blowout preventer, or BOP is a large specialised unit weighing up to 400 tonnes that is used to prevent an oil spill from occurring. It works like a valve to close an oil well, similar to a plumber closing a valve in a pipe, and are proven to be highly effective in ensuring well safety. The BOP is located at the top of the well near the seabed and surrounds the pipe or drill string, which passes through it.</p>
